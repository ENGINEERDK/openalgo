HOST = "http://127.0.0.1:5000"      # Replace with your OpenAlgo server host
WS_URL = "ws://127.0.0.1:8765"      # Replace with your WebSocket server URL

# Alternative configuration examples:

# API_KEY = "your-openalgo-api-key"
# HOST = "http://ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.region.compute.amazonaws.com:5000"
# WS_URL = "ws://ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.region.compute.amazonaws.com:8765"
#

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Never commit the actual config.py file with real API keys
# 2. Copy this sample to config.py and update with your credentials
# 3. The config.py file is gitignored to prevent accidental commits
# 4. Keep your API keys secure and don't share them publicly
